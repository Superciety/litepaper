## Abstract

Superciety is an ecosystem of distributed power, collaboration & fun. Building a better society, a super society, is just a side-effect. Bureaucracy is at a minimum, automation at a maximum. You are your own boss and your talents are your income source.
Superciety is a place where anyone can put their talents to work and get paid in a trustless form. We are empowering the individual on a global stage. Whether you’re a Builder or a Visionary, Superciety is where you will want to be. It is the modern way of work.
We are creating a central place of communities that will organically build a better society. These communities are called Fellowships, and they enable anyone to put their talents to work & get paid for it in $SUPER or the native ESDT of the Fellowship.
If you need help developing on Elrond, or you want to be a builder in the Elrond ecosystem, all services offered within Superciety require you to BUY/HOLD or TRADE $SUPER. This approach will attract experts in different fields that will build tools that are owned by the Community, which is everyone who holds the $SUPER token. This will bring important profits to the Fellowships, that can then be used to further invest into Superciety. Most importantly, everything is community-owned. Your work is rewarded 1:1 and there is no middle-man to take a cut of your earnings. With fellowships, you are not in a factory setting and your work will never be meaningless, instead, it will be sought out and valued.
This is your chance to be part of something bigger.
This is your chance to become a Supercitizen.
This is Superciety.

## Introduction

Societies have evolved over thousands of years from the human needs of conservation, belonging and prosperity. With the advent of settlements, the need for conservation has been met. However, the need for belonging, something deeply ingrained in all of us, is ever present. With the exponential advancement of technology we can be anywhere or everywhere we want to be, at almost any time. We are at a point of global identity, and we are building the tools to create a Super Society. Superciety is here to deliver identity, belonging, purpose and prosperity to its Contributors.
Our main focus is You, the Supercitizen. We are developing a social platform where you will create your identity with experiences, talents, skills and whatever you like to do and are good at. Superciety is a launchpad for individuals and projects rooted in the Elrond blockchain. A place for building, using and sharing all the tools that will help grow a better Society. Superciety will be the central place to interconnect Fellowships with Supercitizens, providing Community-owned tools for collaboration and development, with $SUPER as the base currency.

## Vision

Our vision is to create a solid foundation where individuals, known as Contributors, can share their skills and talents to earn income, or make a living in a trustless manner. We aim to create the central place of communities, driven by projects, called Fellowships that will undertake Quests to help build on the Elrond blockchain and will earn $SUPER as a result.
We are building an ecosystem to solve problems and craft solutions. This is a place to connect the visionaries and the builders of a better society. Superciety’s building concept is simple. It is the place to connect contributors within an ecosystem of fellowships. Contributors can propose projects to the community to get constructive feedback, pull together the team of necessary resources, and start building. Every Supercitizen that is part of a fellowship is adding value and energy that is then rewarded in a trustless format, with $SUPER.
In this system, Fellowships can quickly become DAOs and can even have their own ESDT token if determined necessary, or the financial model requires it. Basically anyone can develop a project and present it to Superciety.
Perhaps you are a construction engineer but you are passionate about editing videos. Here, you can release your creative genius to make presentations for your favorite causes, NFT’s or whatever fellowships you may be interested in. As the fellowship succeeds with your predetermined contributions, you will be rewarded in $SUPER.
To be a Contributor you must establish a SuperID. This SuperID is a tool to help people get to know you, your skill sets, your talents, and your ratings in Superciety. Anyone can see how helpful any Supercitizen has been in the past, and follow their history and contributions.

## Why Superciety?

Simply put, because it is not just another token listing. The $Super token is both a governance and a utility token. Super Citizens are at the heart of Supercity's operation and the platform will be governed entirely by the token holders. Votes will be carried out in proportion to the number of tokens held. Token holders will propel Fellowships by using $SUPER as the currency, paying contributors and accessing all of the community-owned products & services.
All Fellowships will have access to the various Quest Proposals being submitted. Maybe you just need a logo for your project or some help on the development of a smart contract. Then, submit a quest! All contributors will be able to see your quest and offer their help. The quest can include an endowment, in $Super, for the contributor. To avoid any dispute, the $Super will be stored in a smart contract while the quest is being carried out.

But, what is the point of registering a fellowship on Superciety, besides the visibility?

The community of support and a vision for a better society!
To attract the top talent for the right fit, no matter what the project or Quest involves.
To use the launchpad and all the community-owned tools to envision, fund and strategically execute your project goals.

Every month, two springboards will be organized to promote the best projects in the ecosystem.

An innovation springboard, allowing all young fellowship leaders to be highlighted. Any young fellowships can apply for this event. $Super holders can elect their favorite project, which will be highlighted for a month on the platform.

A springboard booster, allowing all fellowships to present their unfinished projects to request participatory funding. $Super holders can vote for whichever they think will provide the most value, and it will be promoted for a month on the platform. For example, a $Super pool could be opened for two weeks for the winning project and the fellowship can then use those $Super for contributions! The fellowship may then provide tokens of their platform or various other incentives to encourage and reward the donors.

## Why Elrond?

Elrond is the first carbon-negative blockchain in Europe.
An active and growing super community with more than 1.3 million accounts
A real decentralization ensured by thousands of nodes around the world
A rich and growing ecosystem of partners, developers & builders
Ease of use of the Maiar application, making access to the Elrond universe simple for everyone
So many points that correspond to the Superciety spirit.

With all the exciting growth within Elrond and all of the strategic steps the Elrond team is taking to push mass adoption, Superciety aims to be a market leader, unleashing people's true talents and skills for project development both inside and outside of the blockchain. It is already commonplace to find people seeking skills or resources to assist their progress with many different projects emerging and many synergies between communities are being created. Superciety’s organic growth will be the bridge between the Multiverse.

## How does it work?

Any user with a Maiar account can create a SuperID and then log on to the platform and create a Fellowship. All you need to do is introduce your goals, a clear direction, and your knowhow.
To ensure clarity on the different metrics used for the visibility of all the projects on the platform, titles are granted. To qualify for a new rank, the individual fellowships must meet the predetermined criteria. Once the criteria are met, the passage to the next rank is enabled by way of a smart contract. A general overview of the titles are as follows:

"Young Fellowship": A minimum of information is required to be visible on the site. Once the project is submitted, it becomes visible only to contributors. All of the contributors involved must validate it in order to grant it the status of young fellowship, thus making the project visible to all.

"Fellowship”: This is the common grade given to communities that have been built and projects that have already been launched.

"Grand Fellowship”: This exceptional grade is given to the most successful projects in the ecosystem, and have an active community of at least 1000 registered members.

"Partner Fellowship”: This rank is awarded only to projects that have developed a partnership relationship with the Superciety project.

## Tokenomics

72% Of the tokens are in circulation (7.2 Million)

Tokens in circulation are the essence of the ecosystem.
The economy of the superciety is based on a burn and mint mechanism of tokens ensuring a stable supply in circulation and a fair distribution of tokens.
Fellowships will be able to use their own ESDT tokens to pay contributors.
When a remuneration is made, a small fee will be applied and the collected tokens will be burned.
Through this mechanism, the evolutionary trend of the circulating supply will be deflationary.

8% of tokens are in liquidity reserve on the DEX (800k)
10% of tokens are for the intensive rewards program (1M)
10% of the tokens are in reserve for growth / burn

The maximum amount of tokens is 12 millions.

Tokens in circulation are the essence of the ecosystem.
The tokens in liquidity reserve provide the minimum basis for the operation of the asset on the DEX. The intensive reward program is as follows:
During 1 year, 1 Million Super will be distributed to $Super! 60% will go to liquidity providers
40% will go to stakers (On superciety.com)

Several burn mechanisms will be put in place and will evolve according to the decisions of the community.
1% of the $Super intended for contributors will be burned during the transaction
1% of the $Super used on the services provided by superciety will be burned during the transaction.
